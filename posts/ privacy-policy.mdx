## 3. Data We Collect

### A. Data Not Collected by Default

The app does **not** require account registration and does not collect names, email addresses, or phone numbers unless you explicitly use a feature that requires them (such as sharing results via email).

### B. Data Collected (If Optional Features Are Used)

* **Medical inputs:** Any numbers or values you enter for calculations (e.g., weight, height, lab results). These remain on your device and are **not** sent to our servers unless you choose to share/export them.
* **Analytics & crash reports:** Anonymous technical information (app version, device type, OS version, error logs) to help us improve the app.
* **Advertising data (if applicable):** If third-party ads are used, the ad provider may collect limited data as per their own privacy policy.

## 4. Why We Use Your Data

* To operate the app and provide accurate calculations.
* To improve user experience, fix bugs, and analyze performance.
* To comply with legal requirements when applicable.
* To maintain safety and quality standards.

---

## 5. Sharing Your Data

* **We do not sell or rent your personal data.**
* We may use trusted third-party services for analytics or crash reporting (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics), which may collect technical data.
* If you choose to share results via email or messaging, the recipient you select will receive the data — we are not responsible for how they use it.
* We will disclose data only if required by law or legal process.

---

## 6. Data Retention

* Calculation inputs remain locally on your device unless you manually save/export them.
* Analytics and crash report data are retained only as long as necessary for improvements (e.g., 6 months) and then deleted according to the provider’s policies.

---

## 7. Data Security

* We follow reasonable security practices to protect data (e.g., encryption in transit, secure local storage).
* No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — avoid entering full patient-identifying health records unless you secure them yourself.

---

## 8. App Permissions

The app may request certain permissions:

* **Storage (optional):** To save or export reports.
* **Internet (optional):** To send crash reports or fetch content updates.
  If you don’t use these features, the app won’t request these permissions.
